# This action will run npm install and npm run build every time a new commit is pushed.
# It will then execute Lighthouse and upload the results.
# Because we added the LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN, the results will be attached as new status checks
# and will pass or fail based on the assert configuration in `.lighthouserc.json`.
